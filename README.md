# Vinyl API
This is a Spring Boot project that creates a REST API to get the items on my vinyl wishlist. I wanted to familiarize myself with using REST APIs in Spring.

## Technologies
The project is written in Java (v. 11.0.8) using the Spring Boot framework (v. 2.4.5) and Jackson (v. 2.12.4).

## Run the Vinyl API
1. Go to the project run configurations, and choose "VinylApiApplication" as the Main Class.
2. Run the application
3. Open a new browser window and visit: http://localhost:8080 where it will display the items posted to the wishlist.
